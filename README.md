Unique ID: A unique identifier for each record.

Indicator ID: Identifier for specific air quality indicators.

Name: Describes the air quality indicator (e.g., "Fine particles (PM 2.5)", "Boiler Emissions- Total SO2 Emissions").

Measure: Type of measurement (e.g., "Mean" or "Number per kmÂ²").

Measure Info: Unit or further detail on the measurement (e.g., "mcg/m3").

Geo Type Name: Type of geographical area (e.g., UHF42).

Geo Join ID: Unique identifier for geographical regions, with some missing values.

Geo Place Name: Name of the geographical area.

Time Period: Period the data represents, ranging from specific years to seasonal averages.

Start_Date: The starting date for the record in mm/dd/yyyy format.

Data Value: Numeric measurement of air quality indicators.

Message: Empty field (all null values), possibly reserved for additional comments.

Initial Observations:

Missing Data: Only the columns "Geo Join ID" and "Geo Place Name" have a few missing values. The "Message" column is entirely null and may be dropped if irrelevant.

Indicator Variety: Multiple air quality indicators are present (e.g., PM2.5, SO2 emissions), enabling analysis of different pollutants.

Temporal Information: The "Time Period" and "Start_Date" columns will allow time-series analysis if data is adequately formatted.
